    **How to Perform a Squat:**
    - **Starting Position**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly turned out.
    - **Movement**: Push your hips back and bend your knees, lowering your body until your thighs are at least parallel to the ground (knees at ~90Â°).
    - **Key Points**:
      - Keep your back straight and chest up to avoid leaning forward.
      - Ensure knees track over toes, not collapsing inward.
      - Engage your core for stability.
    - **Common Mistakes**:
      - Shallow squats (knees not bending enough).
      - Leaning forward, causing back strain.
    - **Tip**: Practice in front of a mirror or use the AI Gym Instructor to check your form!
